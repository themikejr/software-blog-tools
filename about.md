I’m a software developer in the Metro Detroit area.

I thoroughly enjoy problem solving and have had a passion for the internet since my dad helped me build an Angelfire website in elementary school. I work in different languages and technology stacks depending on the project, but I often use Java, Javascript, and Ruby.

I’m a proponent of [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), [Continuous Delivery](https://continuousdelivery.com/), and [Automation](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3197520). I find the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/) and its [Twelve Principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) to be useful.
