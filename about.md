I’m a software developer in the Metro Detroit area. I thoroughly enjoy problem solving and I’ve had a passion for the internet since elementary school. I’ve worked primarily building web apps with Java, JavaScript, and CoffeeScript. I’m a proponent of Test Driven Development, Continuous Delivery, and variety of other practices that are best summed up in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development.

I’ve also dabbled in infrastructure (building servers, configuring web containers, scripting, etc…), software support, and software testing which have each widened my view of Software Development in a unique way.
