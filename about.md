I’m a software developer in the Metro Detroit area. I thoroughly enjoy problem solving and I’ve had a passion for the internet since elementary school. I’ve worked primarily building web apps with Java, JavaScript, and CoffeeScript. I’m a proponent of Test Driven Development, Continuous Delivery, and variety of other practices that are best summed up in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development.
